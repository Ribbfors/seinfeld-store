**Seinfeld Store**

**The Purpose**

My main purpose with this app was to be able to accept payments through Stripe and to store users who signup in a postgreSQL database.\
I integrated this with nextAuth and I also used Prisma.

This was the first time I used both PostgreSQL and Prisma and I enjoyed working with both of them.

**Future updates**

As of now I don't store any completed purchases but I've set up some of the logic for it.\
I will add this functionality with the help of Stripes web hooks and save the order data in the PostgreSQL.\
This will also allow me to customise the success page for the buyer.
